# ruby-iptables
ruby-iptables

This is a somewhat experimental package to leverage ruby manipulation of iptables.
There is probably a better way to do things rather than wrapping
`/sbin/iptables-save` and `/sbin/iptables-restore`, but for now, it should work.

This project is a work-in-progress.  Collaboration in the form of issues, pull requests and/or emails to dataking [at] gmail [dot] com are welcome.
